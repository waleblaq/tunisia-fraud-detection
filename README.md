# tunisia-fraud-detection
Tax fraud is the intentional act of lying on a tax return form with the intent to lower oneâ€™s tax liability. Under-reporting is one of the most common types of tax frauds. It consists of filing a tax return form with a lesser tax base. As a result of this act, fiscal revenues are reduced, undermining public investment in much-needed services. The objective of the challenge is to detect tax fraud. This is one of the main priorities of local tax authorities which are required to develop cost-efficient strategies to tackle this problem.  Using historical data, a supervised machine learning technique that detects potential fraudulent taxpayers will increase the operational efficiency of the tax supervision process.
